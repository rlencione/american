                <p id="text_1">For todayâ€™s Safety Minute, I want to talk about Hand Safety and Injury Prevention. 
                            Before I worked at American Airlines as an engineer, being hired 4 months before 9/11, 
                            I used to be a Master Glass Technician, and I worked with and around many very sharp 
                            and dangerous things that exist in a glass shop work environment. During my 9 years 
                            working in that profession, I witnessed and learned that wearing hand protection was 
                            an absolute necessity to perform almost every aspect of my job when handling glass of 
                            all types in a safe and efficient manner.â€‹Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in 2011 
                            that over 183,400 hand-related injuries occurred on the jobâ€‹A whopping 70% of those 
                            victims WERE NOT wearing protective glovesâ€‹30% WERE wearing gloves, but the gloves were 
                            either ill-fitting or the wrong type for the jobâ€‹Ohio Bureau of Workersâ€™ Compensation 
                            report 30% of all workplace injuries involve cuts or lacerations, and approximately â€‹70% 
                            of those are to the hands or fingers â€“ 10% of all U.S. emergency-room visits by workers 
                            per year are from hand injuries (~3.9M/yr)â€‹Best Practices to Follow: â€‹Use the right tool 
                            for the job â€“ Inspect it thoroughly before starting workâ€‹Make sure blades are sharp â€“ Sharp
                            blades require LESS force to use, thereby reducing the risk of an incident/accident â€‹70%
                            of a jobs risk can be lowered by making sure that WE wear the proper gloves for each
                            job we perform (ref. some types of gloves below)â€‹Neoprene, Nitrile, Latex, Vinyl, Leather,
                            Cotton Fabric, Metal Mesh, Kevlar, Tough Synthetic Yarn, Waterproof, Non-Conductive, Heat 
                            Resistantâ€‹Important Manual References (if applicable): GPM 13.01.10 Protective Equipment List.

                        For todayâ€™s Safety Minute, I want to talk about fuel spills. Recently my station was involved in a known
                        material spill (jet fuel) on the ramp outside of the maintenance hangar. While accomplishing aircraft defuel
                        operations, it was noticed by maintenance personnel that fuel was pouring out of the top of the fueling truck,
                        the defuel operation was halted and local management was notified. The local fire department was called and
                        determined that the total amount of fuel lost was less than 20 gallons. Our maintenance people quickly
                        gathered supplies from the spill kit located inside the hangar and, using proper PPE, contained the spill,
                        preventing any contamination into the local storm drains. The clean-up materials were stored in an
                        appropriate waste container and local management contacted the Department Environmental Coordinator
                        for assistance with the containers. Reference your local spill response plan and the American Airlines
                        Environmental Management Manual (EMM) sections 03.01- 03.08 for guidelines on how to respond to spills.
                        As per EMM section 03.01, it is the policy of American Airlines to respond to spills in an efficient and economic
                        manner, while ensuring the safety of its employees, passengers, facilities and the surrounding environment.
                        The quick actions by maintenance and local management shared in the story above prove that having a spill
                        response plan in place prevented employee injury, aircraft/equipment damage and prevented any adverse
                        impact to the local environment.

                Do you have Emergency Procedures for the elevators in your building? If you work in an older building is your
                elevator up to code? For today's safety minute I'd like to discuss Elevator Safety. There recently wasn an injury
                within Base Maintenance due to an elevator being stuck between floors. When the elevator stopped the
                employee opened the emergency phone to call security to find that the phone had been removed. Panic set
                in and the employee tried to pry the doors open injuring their shoulder trying to escape. It's important all
                team members know what to do if youfind yourself in this situation without a cell phone or two-way
                communication: *First press the alarm button to get the attention of others that the elevator has stopped.
                *Stay calm and try to not panic and wait until assistances in on their way *Do not try to pry open the doors
                and climb out. ASME A17.1 Safety Code for elevators reads: two - way communication means between the car
                and a location staffed by authorized personnel shall be provided. Door restrictors are devices that prevent
                passengers from opening the elevator doors if the elevator stops between floors. Tragic accidents can occur
                when passengers attempt to exit the car and leap to the landing. Passengers need to stay in the elevator until
                trained personnel arrive to remove them safetly. The elevator maintenance service companies have the sole
                responsibility of maintaining and servicing the elevators in a safe and efficient manner. Scheduled inspections,
                tests, and quick response on repairs are specificed in the service contracts.
