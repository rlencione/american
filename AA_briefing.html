                <p id="text_1">For todayâ€™s Safety Minute, I want to talk about Hand Safety and Injury Prevention. Before I worked at American Airlines as an engineer, being hired 4 months before 9/11, I used to be a Master Glass Technician, and I worked with and around many very sharp and dangerous things that exist in a glass shop work environment. During my 9 years working in that profession, I witnessed and learned that wearing hand protection was an absolute necessity to perform almost every aspect of my job when handling glass of all types in a safe and efficient manner.â€‹Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in 2011 that over 183,400 hand-related injuries occurred on the jobâ€‹A whopping 70% of those victims WERE NOT wearing protective glovesâ€‹30% WERE wearing gloves, but the gloves were either ill-fitting or the wrong type for the jobâ€‹Ohio Bureau of Workersâ€™ Compensation report 30% of all workplace injuries involve cuts or lacerations, and approximately â€‹70% of those are to the hands or fingers â€“ 10% of all U.S. emergency-room visits by workers per year are from hand injuries (~3.9M/yr)â€‹Best Practices to Follow: â€‹Use the right tool for the job â€“ Inspect it thoroughly before starting workâ€‹Make sure blades are sharp â€“ Sharp blades require LESS force to use, thereby reducing the risk of an incident/accident â€‹70% of a jobs risk can be lowered by making sure that WE wear the proper gloves for each job we perform (ref. some types of gloves below)â€‹Neoprene, Nitrile, Latex, Vinyl, Leather, Cotton Fabric, Metal Mesh, Kevlar, Tough Synthetic Yarn, Waterproof, Non-Conductive, Heat Resistantâ€‹Important Manual References (if applicable): GPM 13.01.10 Protective Equipment List</p>
